# GrammarPals — Vision

## One-line pitch
GrammarPals is a kid-safe, 5–10 minute web game that teaches English grammar through fun Animal Rescue missions, with a pet coach that uses voice + animations to explain grammar in a way kids understand.

## Goals
- Make grammar practice feel like a real game (animated, playful, rewarding).
- Help kids understand grammar rules (not just guess answers).
- Keep sessions short and satisfying (5–10 minutes).
- Be kid-safe by design (no accounts, no personal data, no ads, no external trackers).

## Target users
- Primary: kids ~7–11 learning English grammar basics.
- Secondary: parents/teachers who want quick, safe practice with clear learning value.

## Core experience (North Star)
In under 10 seconds: open the site → tap Play → pet coach introduces today’s grammar topic (spoken) → answer a short mission of questions → get friendly “why” feedback after each answer → complete the rescue → unlock 1 fun pet accessory.

## The fun loop (gameplay)
1) Animated rescue scene (an animal needs help).
2) Pet coach gives a short audio intro to the grammar rule (10–20 seconds) with 1 simple example.
3) Quiz mission: quick A/B “choose the correct sentence” questions with big buttons.
4) After each answer, the pet explains why it’s right/wrong (5–10 seconds), using kid-friendly language.
5) Mission complete recap: one short line reinforcing the rule.
6) Reward: unlock exactly 1 cosmetic pet accessory with a fun animation; allow equipping immediately.

## Learning approach (v1)
- Grammar-first (not vocabulary-first).
- Start topic for MVP: subject–verb agreement with **is / are**.
- Explanations must be simple, supportive, and specific (“one vs many”).
- Minimal reading load; audio read-aloud is available for prompts and feedback.

## Accessibility requirements
- Big buttons and clear visuals.
- Minimal text on screen; optional read-aloud for every prompt.
- Mute toggle and repeat-audio button.
- Supportive feedback (no shaming language).

## Kid safety & privacy (non-negotiables)
- No personal data collection.
- No accounts / logins.
- No ads.
- No external trackers.
- Store progress locally on the device only.

## Engagement guardrails (fun, not manipulative)
- No streak pressure.
- No guilt messages (“you’ll lose progress if you stop”).
- No forced notifications.
- One reward per session to encourage short play and clean stopping points.

## Open questions to validate (Phase 1 research)
- Best age emphasis (7–9 vs 9–11) and how explanations should adapt.
- Preferred art style (flat cute vs storybook vs more game-like).
- Voice approach: text-to-speech vs recorded voices, and whether multipl
