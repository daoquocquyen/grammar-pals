# Phase 2 — MVP Scope

## Decisions Made

### MVP session format
- Session length: **8 questions** per mission.
- Flow: **Flow B** (includes a halfway “story beat” moment after question 4).

### MVP question types (templates)
- **T3 (Picture clue):** show one vs many animals + choose correct sentence.
- **T2 (Choose correct sentence):** pick between two sentences (one correct, one incorrect).

### MVP rewards
- Launch with **20 pet accessories**.
- Reward rule: **1 accessory unlock per completed session**, stored locally, with unlock + equip animation.

### MVP audio (must-have)
- A **pet/kid-style voice** reads:
  - grammar topic intro,
  - questions,
  - right/wrong explanations.
- Controls: **mute** + **repeat**.

### Explicitly OUT of scope for MVP
- Any grammar topic beyond **is/are**.
- Accounts, logins, cloud sync, user profiles.
- Ads, external trackers, analytics requiring identifiers.
- Large world map / long campaign storyline.
- Multiplayer/classroom dashboards, leaderboards, streaks, notifications.

## Open Questions (to validate in Phase 3–4 / playtesting)
1. Timing: can we keep the mission within **5–10 minutes** with animations + voice?
2. Intro length: do kids prefer **10–15s** or shorter + a skip button?
3. Reward pacing: does “1 accessory per session” feel motivating enough early?
4. Picture clarity: do kids understand “one vs many” best from pictures alone?

## MVP Scope Statement
GrammarPals MVP is a web game where kids play a 5–10 minute Animal Rescue mission focused on **is/are**, guided by a pet coach who introduces the rule and explains every answer using “Clue → Rule,” featuring animated scenes, a halfway story beat, pet-voice read-aloud, and a session-completion reward of 1 new pet accessory (local-only).

## MVP Mission Flow (Flow B)
1. **Home** → “Start Rescue”
2. **Rescue Intro Scene** (short animation)
3. **Pet Topic Intro** (spoken, skippable) + 1 example
4. **Question 1–4**
5. **Halfway Story Beat**: “You’re helping! The animal looks better!” (short animation)
6. **Question 5–8**
7. **Recap** (spoken): “Remember: is = one, are = many.”
8. **Reward Unlock**: 1 accessory unlock animation + equip option
9. **End Screen**: “Play another mission” / “Stop”

## Next Phase Checklist (Phase 3: Game Design — Fun Loop)
- Define the moment-to-moment fun loop (tap → reaction → feedback).
- Define animation beats (intro, answer reactions, halfway beat, win, unlock).
- Define kid-friendly UI principles (big buttons, minimal text, clear layout).
- Define feedback tone and example lines.
