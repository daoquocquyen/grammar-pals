# Phase 1 — Light User Research (Simulated)

## Purpose
We are simulating light user research to guide MVP decisions before building. The goal is to define:
- who we are building for first,
- what “fun” means in this game,
- how the pet should teach grammar so kids truly understand,
- what risks could ruin the experience (boring, too hard, too wordy),
- what we must validate in MVP playtesting.

---

## Decisions Made

### A) Primary Audience
- Target range: **Kids 7–11 (mixed)**
- Design bias: works especially well for younger kids via **minimal reading + strong audio support**.

### B) Fun Pillars (Top Engagement Drivers)
1. **Pet is funny + expressive**
   - Reactions, dances, faces, playful animations on every answer.
2. **Dress-up is the main reward**
   - Collecting **pet accessories** is the primary progression (local-only).
3. **Rescue scenes are mini-stories**
   - Each session has a simple “before/after” rescue moment, not just a quiz.

### C) Teaching Style
- Primary explanation format: **“Clue → Rule”**
  - Example: “We see *two cats* (many) → use **are**.”
- Allowed mix:
  - Sometimes add quick comparison examples, but keep “Clue → Rule” as the consistent default.

### D) Parent-Friendly Value Promise (Emphasize Early)
- **Short sessions, easy stopping**
- **Educational explanations included**
  - Pet introduces the topic before the quiz and explains why answers are right/wrong.

### E) Research Simulation Method Used
- **Method 1: Personas** (kid/parent/teacher)
- **Method 3: “What could go wrong” risks + guardrails**

## Personas (Lightweight)

### Kid Player (7–11)
- Wants: funny pet reactions, quick taps, dress-up rewards, rescue story moments
- Needs: minimal reading, repeat-audio button, safe “try again” feedback

### Parent Gatekeeper
- Wants: short sessions, easy stopping, clear learning value
- Needs: supportive tone, no shame; obvious educational value

### Teacher Ally
- Wants: consistent explanations, focused grammar target
- Needs: repeat practice with clear “Clue → Rule” feedback

## What Could Go Wrong (Risks) + Guardrails

1) **Feels like a worksheet (boring)**
- Guardrail: every question triggers an animation and pet reaction; rescue context present.

2) **Too much reading**
- Guardrail: big buttons, short text, optional voice read-aloud everywhere.

3) **Explanations are confusing**
- Guardrail: consistent “Clue → Rule” pattern using concrete clues (one vs many).

4) **Hard to stop (meltdown risk)**
- Guardrail: clean session ending; 1 reward per session; neutral “Play another” option (no pressure).

5) **Parents distrust the product**
- Guardrail: clear “educational explanations included” messaging; short sessions; (privacy statement will be emphasized later too).

## Open Questions to Validate in MVP / Playtesting
1. **Intro tolerance:** do kids sit through 10–20 seconds, or do we need 5–10 seconds + skip?
2. **Session length:** best number of questions for 5–10 minutes (6 vs 8 vs 10)?
3. **Accessory progression:** how many accessories are needed for early delight (first 20–30)?
4. **Clue clarity:** which clues are easiest (numbers like “two”, plural -s nouns, pictures showing many vs one)?

## Outputs for Next Phase (Phase 2: MVP Scope)
Phase 2 should define:
- the exact MVP session flow (screens and steps),
- what is IN scope vs OUT of scope,
- question count per session,
- minimum accessory set for launch,
- how we’ll validate the open questions quickly.
