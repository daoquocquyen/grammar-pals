# Phase 4 — Learning Design (Grammar Curriculum + Mastery Rules)

## Decisions Made (MVP: is/are)

### Grammar focus (MVP)
- Single skill: **Subject–verb agreement with is/are**
- Core concept: **is = one**, **are = many**
- Teaching style: **Clue → Rule** (consistent pattern)

---

## Mastery Model (MVP)

### Mastery definition (recommended)
- **Mastery A:**
  - In a session of 8 questions, mastery is achieved when:
    - Kid gets **6 of 8 correct**, AND
    - The **last 3 questions** are correct (shows learning during the mission)

### Simple status labels (kid-friendly)
- Status states for is/are:
  - **Learning**
  - **Getting it**
  - **Mastered**

**Rule to update status (local-only):**
- If mastery achieved in the current session → move status one step up (Learning → Getting it → Mastered).
- If not achieved → keep the same status (no punishment).

## Difficulty Progression (8-question mission)

### Difficulty pattern (recommended)
- **Q1–2 (Very Easy):** clear one vs many with strong picture clue (and often a number word like “two”)
- **Q3–4 (Easy):** plural nouns without number word; picture still clear
- **Q5–6 (Medium):** slightly more distracting sentences, but clue remains visible
- **Q7–8 (Medium+):** more sentence variety while staying kid-friendly (still grounded in one vs many)

**Design principle:** never introduce “tricky exceptions” in MVP (e.g., “team”, “family”, “news”).

## Hints & Help (Prefer Gamey)

### Wrong-answer flow (from Phase 3)
- Kid gets a gentle retry after the first wrong attempt.
- Keep sessions short:
  - **Max 2 attempts per question** (1 retry).
  - If still wrong, show the correct answer kindly and move on.

### Hint style (recommended + gamey-friendly)
- **Hint A (Point to clue)**
  - Visually highlight the clue:
    - circle or pulse the animals (one vs many),
    - optionally highlight the number word (one/two/three),
  - Pet says the clue out loud:
    - “Look — there are **two**. That’s **many**…”

### Optional extra gamey assist (allowed)
- After the first wrong attempt, briefly animate the correct clue:
  - e.g., “many” sparkle effect on the group of animals.
- Do NOT remove choices permanently in MVP (avoid confusion and keep learning focused).

---

## Feedback Rules (Audio + Short + Kid-Friendly)

### Timing defaults (recommended)
- Topic intro: **10–15 seconds**, **skippable**
- Per-answer explanation: **3–6 seconds**
- End recap: **2–4 seconds**

### Explanation structure (always)
1) Say the clue (one vs many)
2) Say the rule (is/are)
3) Confirm the answer

Examples:
- Right: “Yes! **Two cats** is **many**, so we use **are**.”
- Wrong: “Nice try! It’s **many** — so we need **are**.”

### “Tell me more” button
- **Yes (recommended for mixed ages)**
  - Optional button after the main explanation:
    - short extra example (1 sentence),
    - still voice-friendly,
    - never required to continue.

---

## Local Progress (No Personal Data)

### What we store locally (recommended minimal)
- Accessories owned / equipped
- Grammar status for is/are: **Learning / Getting it / Mastered**

### What we do NOT store
- Names, emails, age, voice recordings
- Identifiers used for tracking across apps/sites
- Any analytics requiring personal identifiers

---

## Curriculum Expansion (Post-MVP order placeholder)
When we expand beyond is/are:
1. **a / an**
2. **he / she / they**
3. **do / does** (questions)
4. **past vs present** (walk / walked)

---

## Next Phase Checklist (Phase 5: Content Planning)
- Define question templates (T2, T3) precisely.
- Create rules for distractors (wrong options) that teach the common mistakes.
- Decide minimum content count for MVP (enough variation for replay).
- Draft example items for each difficulty bucket (Very Easy → Medium+).
