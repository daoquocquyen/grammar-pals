# ART_STYLE_GUIDE — Puppy Park Sticker Style

## Goal
Create a visual-first, sticker-like art system for GrammarPals. The look is playful, cozy, and kid-safe. All assets must feel like a cohesive sticker pack.

## Core Style
- **2D vector sticker look** with thick outlines.
- **Soft pastel palette** with warm highlights.
- **Rounded, friendly shapes** (no sharp edges).
- **Subtle shadow** (soft drop shadow or offset shadow) to lift stickers off the background.
- **Simple textures only** (no photorealism).

## Outline + Shadow Specs
- Outline: #5B4A3A (or similar warm dark brown), 6–12px depending on asset size.
- Shadow: soft, low-opacity, slightly offset, warm tone.

## Color Palette (suggested)
- Cream: #FFF4DE
- Peach: #FFD3A1
- Butter: #FFE17B
- Mint: #CAFFBF
- Sky: #CFE9FF
- Lavender: #BDB2FF
- Pink: #FFC6FF
- Grass: #C7F1C2
- Warm Brown Outline: #5B4A3A

## Composition Rules
- Keep silhouettes bold and readable at small sizes.
- Avoid tiny details; prioritize shape clarity.
- Use simple facial features: big eyes, small nose, curved mouth.

## Export Rules
- Prefer **SVG** (clean, scalable).
- PNG is acceptable for hand-drawn textures.
- Transparent background for sticker assets (except full backgrounds).

## Asset Naming
Use the filenames listed in `content/assets.manifest.json`.
