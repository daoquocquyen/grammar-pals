# Kid-friendly UI & game feel

## Must-haves
- Big sentence cards / big tap targets
- Minimal reading load
- Clear visual clue (one vs many)
- Audio controls: mute + repeat
- Supportive feedback only (no shame, no guilt)

## Animation guidelines
- Reactions are quick (0.5–1s) and delightful.
- Animations should not block progress; allow tap-to-continue.
- Show visual progress (animal improves each question).
- Keep effects lightweight for performance.

## Tone guidelines
- Right: celebrate gently
- Wrong: “Nice try” + highlight clue + rule
- No pressure mechanics (no streaks/leaderboards/notifications).
